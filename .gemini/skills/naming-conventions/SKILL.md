name: naming-conventions
description: Enforcing strict naming standards during refactoring or new entity creation. This skill dictates snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for types, and predicate forms (is_xxx) for booleans. It aligns codebase with Domain-Driven Design (DDD) terminology as defined in the ubiquitous language dictionary, ensuring consistency across all modules.
