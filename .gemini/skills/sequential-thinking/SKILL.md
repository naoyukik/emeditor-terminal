name: sequential-thinking
description: Reasoning through complex engineering problems using a structured "think" tool. This skill is mandatory before any tool execution or plan generation to verify hypotheses and break down ambiguous requirements into logical steps. It enhances meta-cognition, ensuring every action is grounded in deliberate analysis and multi-step planning.

## "sequential-thinking" as "think" tool

### When to use the think tool

Before taking any action or responding to the user after receiving tool results, use the think tool as a scratchpad to:
- List the specific rules that apply to the current request
- Check if all required information is collected
- Verify that the planned action complies with all policies
- Iterate over tool results for correctness
- Analyze complex information from web searches or other tools
- Plan multi-step approaches before executing them

### How to use the think tool effectively

When using the think tool:
1. Break down complex problems into clearly defined steps
2. Identify key facts, constraints, and requirements
3. Check for gaps in information and plan how to fill them
4. Evaluate multiple approaches before choosing one
5. Verify your reasoning for logical errors or biases

Remember that using the think tool has been shown to improve your performance by up to 54% on complex tasks, especially when working with multiple tools or following detailed policies.

When I do a "Think", we will also disclose all of its logs to the user.
